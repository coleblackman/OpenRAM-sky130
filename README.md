# OpenRAM-sky130

OpenRAM is an open-source static random access memory (SRAM) compiler. This is a very simple fork that adds sky130 resources for compatibility with the Google skywater-130 PDK without additional work. Everything else is upstream, and I'll merge direct from upstream if there are any changes.
